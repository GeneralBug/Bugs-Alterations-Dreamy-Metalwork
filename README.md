# Bug's Alterations - Dreamy Metalwork
A datapack that makes some changes to the Fabric versions of [Create: Dreams & Desires](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-dreams-and-desires), [Create: Metalwork](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-metalwork) and [Create Big Cannons](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-big-cannons), mostly focusing on liquid metal processing. Some changes include:
 - All melting recipes now use the Big Cannons foundary (it's very slow so you'll want several in parallel)
 - All alloying recipes (including netherite) can now only be mixed as fluids
 - Cast iron and industrial iron are treated as interchangeable
 - Added spout recipes for gold foods
